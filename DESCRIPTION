Description: hrqolr simulates randomised clinical trials with temporal 
	trajectories of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as the outcome and quantifies effect 
	sizes as single-sampled HRQoL values at end of follow-up and as the area under the trajectories. 
	Developed as part of the INCEPT (Intensive Care Platform Trial) project (<https://incept.dk/>), 
	which is primarily supported by a grant from Sygeforsikringen "danmark" 
	(<https://www.sygeforsikring.dk/>).
