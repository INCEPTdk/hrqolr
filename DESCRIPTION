Description: hrqolr simulates randomised clinical trials with temporal
	trajectories of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as the outcome and quantifies effect
	sizes as single-sampled HRQoL values at end of follow-up and as the area under the trajectories.
	Developed as part of the INCEPT (Intensive Care Platform Trial) project (<https://incept.dk/>),
	which is primarily supported by a grant from Sygeforsikringen "danmark"
	(<https://www.sygeforsikring.dk/>).
