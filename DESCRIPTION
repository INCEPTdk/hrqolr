Description: Package for simulating two-arm randomised clinical trials with temporal 
    trajectories of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as the outcome and quantifies effect 
    sizes as single-sampled HRQoL values at end of follow-up and as the area under the trajectories. 
    Developed as part of the INCEPT (Intensive Care Platform Trial) project (<https://incept.dk/>), 
    which is primarily supported by a grant from Sygeforsikringen "danmark" 
    (<https://www.sygeforsikring.dk/>).
