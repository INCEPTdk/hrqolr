\usage{
\method{plot}{hrqolr_trajectories}(
  x,
  which = "both",
  arm_aes = NULL,
  patient_aes = list(alpha = 0.2),
  ribbon_aes = list(alpha = 0.2),
  ribbon_percentiles = c(0.25, 0.75),
  ...
)

\method{plot}{hrqolr_trial}(x, analysis = "all", ecdf = TRUE, n = 512, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object to plot, see \emph{Details}.}

\item{which}{character, one of \code{"both"} (arm and patient trajectories, the default), \code{"arm"}
(only arm trajectories), \code{"patient"} (only patient trajectories) and \code{"summarise"} (arm
trajectories with ribbons summarising the patient trajectories).}

\item{arm_aes, patient_aes, ribbon_aes}{lists with additional settings for the arm, patients and
ribbon layers.}

\item{ribbon_percentiles}{scalar of two elements defining the lower and upper percentiles of band
drawn to summarise patient trajectories}

\item{...}{passed on to methods}

\item{analysis}{character, \code{"all"} (include non-survivors and set their HRQoL to 0) or \code{"survivors"}.}

\item{ecdf}{logical, whether to plot the empiricial cumulative distribution (default) or not}

\item{n}{the number of equally spaced points at which the density is
    to be estimated.  When \code{n > 512}, it is rounded up to a power
    of 2 during the calculations (as \code{\link[stats]{fft}} is used) and the
    final result is interpolated by \code{\link[stats]{approx}}.  So it almost
    always makes sense to specify \code{n} as a power of two.
